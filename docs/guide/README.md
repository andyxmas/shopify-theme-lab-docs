# Introduction

Shopify Theme Lab is a customizable modular development environment for blazing-fast Shopify theme creation. It is built on top of the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli). By default, it's bundled with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, but you can swap them for pretty much anything.
